            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>The time value of money (TVM) is a fundamental concept in finance that recognizes that money available now is worth more than the same amount in the future due to its potential earning capacity. Understanding TVM is crucial for business students because:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>It forms the basis for many financial decisions, including investments, loans, and capital budgeting.</li>
                <li>It helps in comparing cash flows occurring at different times.</li>
                <li>It's essential for valuing financial assets and making informed business decisions.</li>
                <li>It demonstrates the importance of investing early and the impact of compound interest.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Instructions</h2>
            <p>1. Click "Start Game" to begin.</p>
            <p>2. You will be presented with 10 random questions about time value of money concepts.</p>
            <p>3. Select the best answer from the four options provided.</p>
            <p>4. If you answer incorrectly, you'll have another chance to select the right answer.</p>
